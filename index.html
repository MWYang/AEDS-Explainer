          <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Like many of his neighbors, Porfirio is a Dominican immigrant. The bodega is a place where neighbors go to watch baseball and smoke cigars.
            Locals know they can count on it for groceries, even when times are tough.
            <br>Porfirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items" target="_blank">Supplemental Nutrition
              Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, also
            known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p>
          <br>But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system. That
          way, long-time patrons could take home food and settle
          their bills later.

              </p> Large. The USDA algorithm affects any business that accepts food stamps. In New York City, that's x% of all grocery and convenient stores. </p>
              <h4> Scope </h4>
              <p>Deep. The loss of revenue for Porfirio was signficant. Moreover, the community lost a reliable food source. </p>
              <h4> Vulnerability </h4>
              <p> In general the USDA algorithm impacts vulnerable communities because it impacts communites that rely on alternative financial systems, who are usually lower income and communities of color.</p>

                  <p>For example, if we use arrest data by neighborhood to distribute the police force, then we may send police to the same neighborhoods that they have historically policed, which leads to more collection of arrest data in those

              <h4> Data </h4>
              </p> Because Porfirio's bodega is in a low-income neighborhood, he is more likely to have more customers with food stamps. This is a bias in the data about bodegas in poor neighborhoods. This means that bodegas like Porfirio's receive
              more scrunity whereas a bodega in a rich neighborhood gets less scrunity. </p>
              <h4> Algorithm Model </h4>
              <p>The algorithm the USDA used to identify cash-for-food-stamps fraud was using large one time purchases as variable to indicate fraud. The algorithm couldn't distinguish between true fraud and Porfirio's IOU system. Someone decided
                that
                the model should flag certain transactions as fraudulent, so there was bias in the model against those kinds of transactions.

              The library feeds ESP is fed circulation data (like which books have been checked out) and sales data (like Amazon purchases). In case you're wondering, no it doesn't use book reviews yet.

              The ESP algorithm looks for historical patterns in the data and makes suggestions for what books to stock at which branches. For example it might predict where the young adult book "Twilight" will be popular because that neighborhood
              has
              lots of teenagers that checked out "Dracula" and "Harry Potter".

              <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> We don't actually know. ESP is a <span class="tooltip_definition"> neural network</span> algorithm, which is kind of a black box. We know which datasets ESP uses, but the
                patterns
                it's using to make recommendations are fuzzy.</p>
              <p>To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might trust that and can draw from their
                experience and knowledge. </p>

              <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Not so fast. </p>
              <p> As a neural network, ESP doesn't work as well if there isn't a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it might have a harder time when guessing which
                debut
                fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a hit with readers </p>
              <p> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals--some of the largest users of library services that
                could purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.</p>
              <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't
                already check out books.</p>

              <p>Yup! Preserving librarians' power to make decisions helps to address the possible problems with ESP. Still, librarians' choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score based on mathematical equations.</p>
              <p>ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own instincts on what their branch needs.</p>

            <p>
              TSAP is a complex ADS because it's covering multiple decision points for the ultimate decision point: who fills one of the vacant public housing units?
            </p>
            <p>There's four main processes going on.
              <p>One process that's happening is decision making about priority codes and screening for eligibility for new applicants.
              </p>A second process that's happening is decision making about priority codes and screening for transfer applications.
              <p>A third process that's happening is predictions on how many units will open up every two weeks, which determines the number of eligibility screenings that NYCHA does for new applicants.
              </p>
              <p>The fourth process going on is actually filling the vacant units.
              </p>
              <p>Here's how those four processes connect:

            <h3 class="nycha_titles">Are different algorithms used in each of the TSAP processes?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Algorithms are used in each of these processes and they are different algorithms, though they all interact with one another.Each of the algorithms that are used are different and their level of automation and flexibility are
              different.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the priority codes for both new applicants and transfers are a pretty simple <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" data-trigger="hover" tabindex="0" class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover"
                data-content="A <b>decision tree</b> is like a flowchart made up of nodes connected by branches. Each node represents a different possibility or 'condition'. <br> So for our avocados it might look something like this:">decision
                tree</a>. It follows a series of yes or no questions to sort people into priority codes. You can look up the different priority codes in the most recent <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/TSAPlan.pdf">TSAP
                documentation</a> from 2016.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, predicting the vacancies and therefore how many eligibility interviews to do of new applicants is more like a <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" data-trigger="hover" tabindex="0"
                class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover"
                data-content="A <b>decision tree</b> is like a flowchart made up of nodes connected by branches. Each node represents a different possibility or 'condition'. <br> So for our avocados it might look something like this:">linear
                regression</a>. The formula to predict vacancies relies on previous data on actual vacancies and past data on the number of applicants that was needed to fill vacancies of a similar size.
            </p>
            <p>All of the algorithms can be changed if a Mayor really wants to. They need to go through a review process to make amendments to NYCHA's general plan.

                <p>The data TSAP uses is based on historical data and the data that is inputed either by new applicants, transfer requests, or case workers helping people who are new applicants or asking for transfers.</p>
                <h4> Algorithm Model </h4>
                <p>There are multiple algorithms in this ADS. It seems like NYCHA is trying to use the best algorithm for each decision type.</p>

                  Certain parts of the ADS are more explainable than others. For example, what the priority codes are and what the qualifications for these priority codes is pretty explainable, but predicting vacant units and how that impacts
                  eligibility interviews is less explainable.

                Every year, more than 80,000 New York City eighth graders transition to high schools. There are nearly 700 high school programs in more than 400 schools across the City, all with different locations, eligibility requirements, and
                number of seats. How do we make sure that students get to go to the best high school for them when there's so many data points?

              <h3>DOE's two-sided deferred-acceptance matching algorithm</h3>
              <p>
                DOE uses an algorithm that goes by many names: centralized clearinghouse, medical residency match, two-sided deferred acceptance matching, applicant-proposing acceptance algorithm, etc. </p>

              <p>All of these names are referring to the same algorithm within the ADS of matching students to high schools. </p>

              <p>Here's how it works.</p>

              <h3>Some students have to go through a second matching process?</h3>
              <p>
                Unfortunately the algorithm does not necessarily match everyone. You might give a list of 12 schools you love, but those schools love other students more than you and so you don't end up with a spot to the school. </p>

              <p>That being said, the DOE algorithm is an improvement from the previous system. Before the DOE started using this matching algorithm when economists helped to design it in 2005, almost 30,000 students were not getting matched with any
                school on their list. After the implementation, the number of unmatched students dropped to 3,000. </p>

              <p>Granted, the original process had students only rank five schools and now students rank twelve schools, but still this drop in unmatched students is seen as an improvement.</p>

              <h3> So...this is a better process, right?</h3>
              <p> Well, it depends on your perspective. </p>
              <p>
                It is a better process for its design: the New York City Independent Budget Office in a 2016 report described the matching algorithm as "designed to assign as many students as possible into programs that they rank highly, given
                constraints due to limited seats and the high schools' own
                admission priorities." </p>
              <p>So, what the matching algorithm does not do is challenge the schools' admissions priorities or improve school quality or resources across the board. </p>
              <p>Most schools in New York City have admissions priorities, and some people think that those priorities contribute to school segregation. Neither the algorithm nor the ADS process as whole challenge schools' admisisons priorities.<p>
                  <p>The screening process also does not apply to the 8 specialized high schools where students qualify by taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHAT), nor does it apply to the 1 audition school in NYC (LaGuardia High
                    School), nor does it apply to the many charter schools in the City. These schools, the ones that are not involved in the algorithm, tend to be more competitive to get in to and might have more resources. <p>
                      <p>The algorithm and the ADS overall do not help challenge unjust systems that might be making New York City Schools some of the most segregated in the country. </p>

              <h3> Imagine if the ADS was designed to make schools more integrated!</h3>
              <p><a href="https://inychackathon.splashthat.com/" target="_blank">Some advocates are doing just that.</a></p>
              <p>
                They're thinking about ways that we could design the admissions priorities that the schools have for how they rank students. Their belief is that if we design the priorities to be focused on the purpose or goal of integrating schools,
                then we will create an algorithm that is better at achieving those goals than what we currently have. </p>
              <p>Now that you know about algorithms, think about how that would work: how would changing school priorities impact the matching algorithm? What would be your vision for how to change the school's admissions priorities? </p>

                  </p> This algorithm uses data from students ranking their preferences and schools ranking their preferences with admissions priorities. These data sets can be very biased. Student rankings are based on their own perceptions of their
                  competitivity in the proces, their parents' knowledge about which schools are best, their desire to stay with their friends. The school preferences based on admissions priorities are biased to just track what the schools want to
                  focus on. If they want to focus on good grades, they can do that. If they want to focus on students in the neighborhood, they can do that.</p>

                  <p>In May of 2018, Mayor de Blasio launched the Automated Decisions Taskforce in May of 2018 to review “automated decision systems, commonly known as algorithms, through the lens of equity, fairness and accountability.”</p>
                  <p>The best way to try to make sure the ADS Taskforce is doing its work and tackling issues that interest or concern you is to reach out to your local City Council member. You can go to Who Represents Me? NYC at http://www.mygovnyc.org/ to type in your address and find out who represents you in New York City and State.</p>
                  <p>Remember to ask your City Council member about the purpose and technical evaluation criteria we gave you! Ask things like:</p>

                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
                    What are the next ADSs that you think the City will be making?<br>
                    Why do you think the City will add automation to that decision making process? <br>
                    How can I help make sure that the City says that the purpose of the automation is to [undo systems of injustice and unfairness]? I know that a neutral algorithm might worsen unjust systems.<br></p>
                  <p><strong>Impact</strong><br>
                    Who does this decision making process impact? How many people?<br>
                    What is the resources or service its impacting for those people?</p>
                  <p><strong>Bias</strong><br>What are the biases in the data set that the algorithm might be using? <br>
                    How can we use those biases for good? <br>
                    What is the model that the algorithm will be using?</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p><strong>Explainability</strong><br>
                    Can you explain to me how the algorithm in this ADS works? <br>
                    Can you explain to me the overall decision system of the ADS? </p>
                  <p><strong>Automation</strong><br>
                    Does the result of the algorithm determine the decision or does it just advise agency staff people in making a decision? <br>
                    Are agency staff people trained about unjust systems? <br>
                    If they saw a result that was unjust, would they know that it is unjust and how to correct it?</p>
                  <p><strong>Flexibility</strong><br>
                    Do people know that this decision is made through an ADS?<br>
                    How would they be able to give feedback if they think the decision is wrong?<br>
                    Who updates the ADS based on feedback and how often do they update it based on feedback?</p>
