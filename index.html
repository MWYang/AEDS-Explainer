            <p> Like many of his neighbors, Profirio is a Dominican immigrant. The bodega is a place where neighbors go to watch baseball and smoke cigars.
              Locals know they can count on it for groceries, even when times are tough. <br><br>Profirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items"
                target="_blank">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, also
              known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). <br><br>But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system. That
              way, long-time patrons could take home food and settle
              their bills later.

                <h2 data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">So, which factors matter when ESP rates books?</h2>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> We don't actually know. ESP is a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) algorithm, which is kind of a black box. We know which datasets ESP
                  uses, but the patterns it's using to make recommondations
                  are
                  fuzzy. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they
                  serve, we might trust that and can draw from their
                  experience
                  and knowledge. <p>
              </div>
              <div class="col"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="row align-items-center">
              <div class="col"></div>
              <div class="col-10">
                <h2 data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">But we get better book picks, right?</h2>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> Not so fast. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> As a neural network, ESP doesn't work as well if there isn't a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well.
                  But it might have a harder time when guessing which
                  debut
                  fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a big hit. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income
                  individuals--some of the largest users of library services that
                  could
                  purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the
                  algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't
                  already
                  check out books. </p>

                <h2 data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">Don't librarians still have final say?</h2>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> Yup! Preserving librarians' decision helps to address the possible problems with ESP. Still, librarians' choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score
                  based on mathematical equations. </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)"> ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own
                  instincts on what their branch needs. </p>
