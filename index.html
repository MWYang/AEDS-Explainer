              <p>ESP is fed circulation data (like which books have been checked out) and sales data from a book warehouse called Baker & Taylor. It uses book reviews, but only in aggregate (total number of reviews, not whether they were good or
                bad).</p>

              <p>The ESP algorithm looks for historical patterns in the data and makes suggestions for what books to stock at which library branches. For example it might predict that the young adult book <i>Twilight</i> will be popular in a specific
                branch because that branch
                has lots of teenagers that checked out <i>Dracula</i> and <i>Harry Potter.</i></p>

                patterns
                it's using to make recommendations are fuzzy.</p>
              <p>To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might them, expecting that they draw from their experience and knowledge. </p>

                  network</a>, ESP works best when there is a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics, like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it would have a harder time guessing which
                debut
                fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a hit with readers. </p>
              <p> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals. These communities are some of the largest users of
                library services, and they might also purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.</p>
              <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better book." What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who

                choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score based on mathematical equations.</p>
              <p>ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own instincts on what their branch needs.</p>

              The Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan (TSAP) is an ADS that does what it says in the name: select and assign tenants to apartments that open up.
            </p>
            <p>It’s built to do this as soon as possible, to make sure units don’t go unfilled for too long in a city where many people need shelter. In fact, the process begins even before units are vacated, by predicting which units will go vacant
              in the next six months. This helps NYCHA make sure it has staff resources and a ready waitlist of eligible and certified New Yorkers to fill apartments when they open up.

              <br><br>These two groups of applicants are assigned “priority codes” based on their income, needs, and other priorities for the City (like having experienced domestic abuse, hate crimes, or involuntary displacement; or being a homeless

              those units. Then, it figures out how many new applicants from the general waiting list might be eligible and should get interviewed to be certified.

              family size will fit in the number of bedrooms for the unit that's predicted to be vacant; if the unit is specifically for elderly people, then making
              sure the applicant is old enough for the unit's requirements; etc). If they pass, they’ll be “certified” and placed in the pool to fill units.

            <p>Once a vacant unit actually opens up, the computer program looks for people who are certified and eligible. It prioritizes transfers with high-needs, then transfers with less urgent needs and new applicants.
              <br><br>Sometimes this matching process can get tricky because there might be only one unit, but multiple certified and eligible applicants with different high-needs. TSAP's matching algorithm has to work to figure out how to sort
              competing priority codes.

                <p>The data TSAP uses is based on both historical data and new data input by new applicants, transfer requests, or case workers. The algorithm makes a prediction about how many units will be vacated based on how many units of a
                  certain type were vacated in the past. However, there might be other factors at play in the present day that the algorithm can’t account for. For example, maybe that building was renovated and fewer people want to leave now. This is
                  called omitted variable bias.
                </p>
                <h4> Algorithmic Model </h4>

                <p>The actual algorithms (decision trees and linear regressions) used by TSAP are pretty explainable.

                  <p>Certain parts are easier to understand than others. For example, what the priority codes are and what the qualifications for these priority codes are is clearly laid out, but predicting vacant units and how that impacts
                    eligibility interviews is more opaque.

                The Department of Education (DOE) uses an algorithm that goes by many names: centralized clearinghouse, two-sided deferred acceptance matching, and applicant-proposing acceptance algorithm. All of these names refer to the same

              <h4 class="center">1. Students Submit</h4>
              <p>A student will apply to schools online, through a school counselor, or at a Family Welcome Center. In their application, they rank up to 12 schools in order of preference.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4 class="center">2. Schools Submit</h4>
              <p>Simultaneously each year, schools submit their information, like how many seats they have and what criteria they have for how to rank or prioritize students that apply to their school.</p>
              <p>For example, some schools called "screened schools" might say that they give priority to students with the highest 8th grade GPA first.
                Some schools called "zoned schools" might say that they give priority to students who live in their neighborhoods.</p>

              Students who are still unmatched get to resubmit a list of ranked schools from a list of schools that still have seats for a second round of the matching process.</p>

              <p>
                Unfortunately the algorithm doesn’t match everyone. About 3,000 students find themselves without a school after the first round and have to go through a second round of matching. </p>

              <p>It used to be worse. Before the DOE started using this matching algorithm, about 30,000 students weren’t getting matched with any school. In 2005, the DOE enlisted economists to help redesign it. They dropped the number of matchless
                students, in part, by having them rank twelve schools instead of just five. </p>

              <p>
                The new algorithm helps to more efficiently “assign as many students as possible into programs that they rank highly, given constraints due to limited seats and the high schools' own admission priorities,” as the New York Independent
                Budget Office <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/preferences-and-outcomes-a-look-at-new-york-citys-public-high-school-choice-process.html" target="_blank">reported in 2016.</a> </p>
              <p>But the matching algorithm doesn’t challenge the underlying unjust system that maintains school segregation and the unequal distribution of educational resources. It doesn’t challenge the specific admissions priorities and
                preferences of schools. These priorities and preferences can perpetuate school segregation. </p>
              <p>Also, the matching process doesn’t apply to more competitive or highly resourced schools, like charter schools or the eight specialized high schools where students qualify by taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test
                (SHSAT). There might be good reasons for excluding some of these schools from the system, but redesigning the ADS could have been an opportunity to think critically about these reasons. </p>

                They're thinking about ways that we could design the admissions priorities that schools use to rank students. They believe that if we design the priorities with the express purpose of integrating schools, we will create an algorithm

                  <p> This algorithm uses data from students and schools ranking their preferences, thus making the datasets very biased. Student rankings are based on their own perceptions of their competitiveness in the process, their parents' knowledge about which schools are best, and other factors we may not know. School rankings are based on their admissions priorities, which track what the schools want to focus on. If they want to focus on good grades, they can do
                    that. If they want to focus on students in the neighborhood, they can do that.</p>
                  <h4> Algorithmic Model </h4>
                  <p>The algorithm maximizes top mutual matches for students and schools. This algorithm is used in other matching situations, like matching medical students to residencies.</p>

                  <p> The matching algorithm is explainable. It follows a clear series of steps and is based on the preferences of students and schools. </p>

                  <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/nyregion/how-game-theory-helped-improve-new-york-city-high-school-application-process.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> has covered the matching algorithm and how it works, making
                    this ADS pretty transparent.</p>

                  <p>Also, the DOE has made the process transparent to families through the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2019nychsdirectorycitywideenglish" target="_blank">High School
                      Directory</a>, a document that guides students through the high school application and matching process.</p>

                  <h4> Ability and Access to Update </h4>
