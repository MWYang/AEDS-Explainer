          <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Like many of his neighbors, Porfirio is a Dominican immigrant. The bodega is a place where neighbors go to watch baseball and smoke cigars.
            Locals know they can count on it for groceries, even when times are tough.
            <br>Porfirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items" target="_blank">Supplemental Nutrition
              Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, also
            known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p>
            <br>But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system. That
            way, long-time patrons could take home food and settle
            their bills later.

            <h4> Scale </h4>
            </p> Large. The USDA algorithm affects any business that accepts food stamps. In New York City, that's x% of all grocery and convenient stores. </p>
            <h4> Scope </h4>
            <p>Deep. The loss of revenue for Porfirio was signficant. Moreover, the community lost a reliable food source. </p>
            <h4> Vulnerability </h4>
            <p> In general the USDA algorithm impacts vulnerable communities because it impacts communites that rely on alternative financial systems, who are usually lower income and communities of color.</p>

                <p>Data being biased means that when we analyze the data, the data might tell us to do something that's not purely objective. It might tell us to do something based on the existing biases of the world that it's capturing. </p>

                <p>For example, if we use arrest data by neighborhood to distribute the police force, then we may send police to the same neighborhoods that they have historically policed, which leads to more collection of arrest data in those

                  neighborhoods. This creates a vicious cycle. </p>

                <p>These biases can arise because all datasets, to some extent, are incomplete, don't accurately represent the thing they're supposed to represent, and have historical mistakes that new data is building on.</p>

            <h4> Data </h4>
            </p> Because Porfirio's bodega is in a low-income neighborhood, he is more likely to have more customers with food stamps. This is a bias in the data about bodegas in poor neighborhoods. This means that bodegas like Porfirio's receive
            more scrunity whereas a bodega in a rich neighborhood gets less scrunity. </p>
            <h4> Algorithm Model </h4>
            <p>The algorithm the USDA used to identify cash-for-food-stamps fraud was using large one time purchases as variable to indicate fraud. The algorithm couldn't distinguish between true fraud and Porfirio's IOU system. Someone decided
              that
              the model should flag certain transactions as fraudulent, so there was bias in the model against those kinds of transactions.

            The ESP algorithm looks for historical patterns in the data and makes suggestions for what books to stock at which branches. For example it might predict where the young adult book "Twilight" will be popular because that neighborhood has
            lots of teenagers that checked out "Dracula" and "Harry Potter".

              it's using to make recommendations are fuzzy.</p>
            <p>To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might trust that and can draw from their
              experience and knowledge. </p>

            <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Not so fast. </p>
            <p> As a neural network, ESP doesn't work as well if there isn't a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it might have a harder time when guessing which debut
              fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a hit with readers </p>
            <p> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals--some of the largest users of library services that
              could purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.</p>
            <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't
              already check out books.</p>

            <p>Yup! Preserving librarians' power to make decisions helps to address the possible problems with ESP. Still, librarians' choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score based on mathematical equations.</p>
            <p>ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own instincts on what their branch needs.</p>

          <p>
            TSAP is a complex ADS because it's covering multiple decision points for the ultimate decision point: who fills one of the vacant public housing units?
          </p>
          <p>There's four main processes going on.
          <p>One process that's happening is decision making about priority codes and screening for eligibility for new applicants.
          </p>A second process that's happening is decision making about priority codes and screening for transfer applications.
          <p>A third process that's happening is predictions on how many units will open up every two weeks, which determines the number of eligibility screenings that NYCHA does for new applicants.
          </p>
          <p>The fourth process going on is actually filling the vacant units.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how those four processes connect:

          <h3 class="nycha_titles">Are different algorithms used in each of the TSAP processes?</h3>
          <p>Yes. Algorithms are used in each of these processes and they are different algorithms, though they all interact with one another.Each of the algorithms that are used are different and their level of automation and flexibility are different.
          </p>
          <p>For example, the priority codes for both new applicants and transfers are a pretty simple <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" data-trigger="hover" tabindex="0" class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A <b>decision tree</b> is like a flowchart made up of nodes connected by branches. Each node represents a different possibility or 'condition'. <br> So for our avocados it might look something like this:">decision tree</a>. It follows a series of yes or no questions to sort people into priority codes. You can look up the different priority codes in the most recent <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nycha/downloads/pdf/TSAPlan.pdf">TSAP documentation</a> from 2016.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, predicting the vacancies and therefore how many eligibility interviews to do of new applicants is more like a <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" data-trigger="hover" tabindex="0" class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A <b>decision tree</b> is like a flowchart made up of nodes connected by branches. Each node represents a different possibility or 'condition'. <br> So for our avocados it might look something like this:">linear regression</a>. The formula to predict vacancies relies on previous data on actual vacancies and past data on the number of applicants that was needed to fill vacancies of a similar size.
          </p>
          <p>All of the algorithms can be changed if a Mayor really wants to. They need to go through a review process to make amendments to NYCHA's general plan.

            <p>That being said, the DOE algorithm is an improvement from the previous system. Before the DOE started using this matching algorithm when economists helped to design it in 2005, almost 30,000 students were not getting matched with any school on their list. After the implementation, the number of unmatched students dropped to 3,000. </p>

            <p>Granted, the original process had students only rank five schools and now students rank twelve schools, but still this drop in unmatched students is seen as an improvement.</p>

            <h3> So...this is a better process, right?</h3>
            <p> Well, it depends on your perspective. </p>
            <p>
              It is a better process for its design: the New York City Independent Budget Office in a 2016 report described the matching algorithm as "designed to assign as many students as possible into programs that they rank highly, given constraints due to limited seats and the high schools' own
              admission priorities." </p>
              <p>So, what the matching algorithm does not do is challenge the schools' admissions priorities or improve school quality or resources across the board. </p>
              <p>Most schools in New York City have admissions priorities, and some people think that those priorities contribute to school segregation. Neither the algorithm nor the ADS process as whole challenge schools' admisisons priorities.<p>
              <p>The screening process also does not apply to the 8 specialized high schools where students qualify by taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHAT), nor does it apply to the 1 audition school in NYC (LaGuardia High School), nor does it apply to the many charter schools in the City. These schools, the ones that are not involved in the algorithm, tend to be more competitive to get in to and might have more resources. <p>

              <p>
              They're thinking about ways that we could design the admissions priorities that the schools have for how they rank students. Their belief is that if we design the priorities to be focused on the purpose or goal of integrating schools, then we will create an algorithm that is better at achieving those goals than what we currently have. </p>
              <p>Now that you know about algorithms, think about how that would work: how would changing school priorities impact the matching algorithm? What would be your vision for how to change the school's admissions priorities? </p>
