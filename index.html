          <p>He's been running P&L Deli Grocery--a quintessential New York City bodega in Washington Heights--since 2012. As a Dominican immigrant himself, Profirio knows his community well. The bodega is a place where neighbors go to watch baseball
            and smoke cigars, and the locals (largely low-income immigrant families) know they can depend on for groceries through the ups and downs. </p>

        <div data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">
          <p> Profirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group to promote fruits and vegetables and knows the importance of the [Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP)] in a city where [15% of families are food
            insecure](https://www.foodbanknyc.org/research-reports/). More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP. When their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system, allowing long-time patrons to take home
            food and settle their bills later.

        </div>
        <div data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">
          <p>Porfirio got a notice from the [NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA)] that his establishment was disqualified from accepting SNAP on suspicion of food stamp fraud. Earlier that year, the city, coordinating with the [USDA], started
            using an computer program to find cases of trading cash for food stamps. </p>

          <p> While the computer program hasn't been made public, it's likely that Porfirio's IOU system triggered the fraud suspicion. The [algorithm] (or set of instructions) used by the program may have noticed large one-time purchases made at P&L
            and mistakenly assumed it was a case of cash-for-food stamps fraud. P&L wasn't alone: the majority of businesses impacted by this new system have been small owner-owned shops in low-income neighborhoods like Porfirio's.

          <p> Porfirio is struggling to keep P&L going. His sales have dropped by 30%. The USDA told Proferio to come up with itemized receipts to prove his innocence, but Porfirio's registers were only able to print total sales figures. The letters
            from his patrons that he sent in as proof were deemed insufficient evidence. Porfirio has called NYC HRA, but no one has been able to reverse the decision made by the algorithm.

          <h2>Libraries use ESP to guess what we want to read</h2>
          <br>
          No, not extra-sensory perception.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong> ESP is an algorithm that uses library and non-library data to recommend books it thinks will be popular.</strong> Here's how the system works:
        </div>
        <div class="col"></div>
      </div>

      <div class="row" data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">

        <div class="col-4">
          ESP is fed library patron data (like how many books by a particular author were checked out) and sales data (like Amazon purchases and reviews). In case you're wondering, no it doesn't use book reviews yet.
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          The ESP algorithm looks for historical patterns in the data and makes suggestions for what books to stock at which branches. For example it might predict where the young adult book "Twilight" will be popular because that neighborhood has
          lots of teenagers that checked out "Dracula" and "Harry Potter".
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          Then, it's up to the librarian to choose whether or not to follow the algorithm's advice.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row align-items-center" data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut)">
        <div class="col"></div>
        <div class="col-8">
          <h2>So, which factors matter when ESP rates books?</h2>
          We don't actually know. ESP is a [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) algorithm, which is kind of a black box. We know which datasets ESP uses, but the patterns it's using to make recommondations are
          fuzzy.
          <br>
          <br>
          To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might trust that and can draw from their
          experience
          and knowledge.

          <h2>But we get better book picks, right?</h2>
          Not so fast.
          <br>
          <br>
          As a neural network, ESP doesn't work as well if there isn't a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it might have a harder time when guessing which debut
          fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a big hit.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals--some of the largest users of library services that could
          purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.
          <br>
          <br>
          Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't
          already
          check out books.

          <h2>Don't librarians still have final say?</h2>
          Yup! Preserving librarians' decision helps to address the possible problems with ESP. Still, librarians' choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score based on mathematical equations.
          <br>
          <br>
          ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own instincts on what their branch needs.
