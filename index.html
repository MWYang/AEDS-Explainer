          <p class="body_emphasis">Since 2012, Porfirio's been running 128 P&L Deli Grocery, a bodega in Washington Heights.</p>
          <p>Locals know they can count on him for groceries, even when times are tough. Just as important, the bodega serves as a space for building community &mdash; a place where neighbors go to hang out, watch baseball, and smoke cigars.
          </p>
          <p> Like many of his neighbors, Porfirio is a Dominican immigrant. He works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also
            known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p>
          <p>But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, <strong> he let patrons take groceries home trusting that they would come back later to settle their bills, like an informal IOU system</strong>. This IOU system allowed Porfirio to help
            members of his community feel secure about their food even if they felt insecure about their finances.

            <p>Porfirio got a notice from the USDA that his establishment was disqualified from accepting SNAP on suspicion of food
              stamp fraud. Earlier that year, the City, coordinating with the USDA, started

 “To create a model, then, we make choices about what’s important enough to include, simplifying the world into a toy version that can be easily understood and from which we can infer important facts and actions. We expect it to handle only one job and accept that it will occasionally act like a clueless machine, one with enormous blind spots.”

          </p>
          <p>For example, think of access to credit and financial resources.</p>
          <p>Poor communities and communities of color often have limited access to credit. This is the legacy of policies like redlining that prevented people who lived in non-White and
            immigrant neighborhoods from getting mortgage loans. The racial and class prejudices of bankers have led to discrimination against groups that they stereotyped as less reliable. If you look around, you’ll notice that, even today, the
            kinds of lenders in communities of color are often high-fee check-cashing services rather than banks.</p>
          <p>All of these conditions create a system that reinforces poverty and prevents people from building wealth.</p>

          <h3>How can ADSs address these systems?</h3>
          <p>We can start with the ADS’s purpose &mdash; what it’s intended to accomplish.</p>
          <p class="body_emphasis">At a minimum, an ADS’s purpose should include actively <b>understanding the unjust systems its operating within</b>. At best, ADSs will actively <b>work to undo the injustice</b>.</p>
          <p>In Porfirio’s case, the USDA’s ADS failed to account for his customers’ lack of access to credit and the need for an informal IOU system. If the USDA had understood the unjust system it was operating within, it could have designed its
            ADS to distinguish between real fraud and Porfirio’s method for extending credit.
          </p>
          <p>Even better, if the USDA sought to undo injustice, it could design the ADS to target the conditions that lead to poor credit access. The ADS might identify areas to increase SNAP benefits, make them more flexible, or use even bolder
            solutions.

          <p>Nope.
          </p>
          <p>Most government ADSs are intended to increase efficiency. For example, the USDA’s ADS was meant to efficiently catch SNAP (food stamp) fraud. A computer is faster than a human at looking through thousands of pages of financial records.
          </p>
          <p>But efficiency alone is not a good purpose. Efficiency speeds up processes, but if that process is already creating inequality, speeding it up makes things worse.

          <div class="body_takeaway">Bias in the data or algorithm might worsen unjust systems. </div>

          <h3>Data</h3>
          <p><b>Data is never objective. </b>We embed our human bias when we collect, store, and use data. All data is biased; it may contain errors or reflect existing inequalities in the world or both.</p>

          <p>When data is biased, it might tell us to do something that's not purely objective. It might tell us to do something based on the existing biases of the world that it's capturing. </p>

          <p>For example, if we use arrest data by neighborhood to distribute the police force, we may send police to the same neighborhoods that they have historically policed, which leads to even more collection of arrest data in those same
            neighborhoods. This might then be used to justify sending even more police to that neighborhood. This creates a vicious cycle. </p>

          <p>These biases can arise because all datasets, to some extent, are incomplete. It is impossible to capture the world absolutely and perfectly. The best datasets try to be as complete as they need to be for the purpose and acknowledge their
            bias.</p>

          <h3>Algorithmic Model</h3>
          <p><b> The type of algorithm an ADS uses and the way it handles the variables and data points matter.</b> Choosing the best algorithm for the problem depends on the ADS's purpose. There are hundreds of different algorithms that each
            calculate outputs slightly differently. There will always be trade-offs in deciding what model to use, and we must think carefully about each case and the potential harms.</p>

          <p>If humans are determining specific components of the algorithm, this can also create bias. For many algorithms, humans will be determining the outcome of interest and the variables. These decisions are subjective because they are based
            on our own values and world views. For example, if you don't know that geographic area is highly linked to race and socioeconomic status, you might accidentally bias the algorithm by including this variable.

          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>Before we can even begin to understand how an ADS works, we need to be able to find information about it. To be completely transparent, an ADS's algorithms and data (as long as privacy concerns are met) should be made publicly available
            with documentation explaining them.</p>

          <h3>Ease of Understanding</h3>
          <p>Some algorithms are very easy to understand, like instructions for choosing an avocado. We know exactly which variables are going into the model and how they're weighted. </p>

          <h3>Low Automation</h3>
          <p>The ADS doesn't make a decision. It simply analyzes the data which is then used to inform a human decision. </p>
          <p>Imagine a dashboard that tells you what percentage of reported potholes have been filled this month without suggesting a specific next action.</p>
          <h3>Medium Automation</h3>
          <p>The algorithm provides an advisory decision, but a human still looks over the decision and decides whether to implement it. </p>
          <p>Imagine a scoring system that prioritizes buildings to inspect for fire risk. </p>

          <p>An algorithm makes a decision and the people using it simply implement that decision. </p>

          <h3>Ability and Access to Update</h3>

              <h4> Scale </h4>
              <p>Large scale. The USDA algorithm affects any business that accepts food stamps. In New York City, 1.6 million low income people rely on
                SNAP.</p>
              <h4> Scope </h4>
              <p>Deep. The loss of revenue for Porfirio was significant. Moreover, the community lost a reliable food source. </p>
              <h4> Vulnerability </h4>
              <p>In general the USDA algorithm impacts vulnerable communities because it impacts communities that rely on alternative financial systems, which are usually lower income and communities of color.</p>

              <p>Because Porfirio's bodega is in a low-income neighborhood, he is more likely to have more customers with food stamps. While the data is technically accurate, it is geographically skewed so that bodegas like Porfirio's receive
                more scrutiny whereas bodegas in rich neighborhoods receive less scrutiny.</p>
              <h4> Algorithmic Model </h4>
              <p>The algorithmic model the USDA used to identify 'cash for food stamps' fraud was using large one time purchases as a variable to indicate fraud. The model was designed in such a way that it couldn't distinguish between true fraud and
                Porfirio's IOU system. It simply flagged certain transactions as fraudulent, so there was bias in the model against those kinds of transactions.</p>

                it's using to make recommendations are fuzzy.</p>
              <p>To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might trust that and can draw from their

                  network</a>, ESP works best when there is a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it would have a harder time when guessing which
                debut
                fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a hit with readers. </p>
              <p> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals. These communities are some of the largest users of
                library services, and they might also purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.</p>
              <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better book." What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who

              The Tenant Selection and Assignment Plan (TSAP) is an ADS that does what it says in the name: select and assign tenants to apartments that open up.
            </p>
            <p>It’s built to do this as soon as possible, to make sure units don’t go unfilled for too long in a city where many people need shelter. In fact, the process begins even before units are vacated, by predicting which units will go vacant
              in the next six months. This helps NYCHA make sure it has staff resources and a ready waitlist of eligible and certified New Yorkers to fill apartments when they open up.

              <br><br>These two groups of applicants are assigned “priority codes” based on their income, needs, and other priorities for the City (like having experienced domestic abuse, hate crimes, or involuntary displacement; or being a homeless

            <h4 class="center">2. Predict</h4>
            <p>Every two weeks, TSAP uses a computer program to predict the types of units that are most likely to be vacated in the next six months.<br><br> The algorithm first looks at how many eligible and certified transfer applicants can fill
              those units. Then, it figures out how many new applicants from the general waiting list might be eligible and should get interviewed to be certified.

              family size will fit in the number of bedrooms for the unit that's predicted to be vacant; if the unit is specifically for elderly people, then making
              sure the applicant is old enough for the unit's requirements; etc). If they pass, they’ll be “certified” and placed in the pool to fill units.

            <p>Once a vacant unit actually opens up, the computer program looks for people who are certified and eligible. It prioritizes transfers with high-needs, then transfers with less urgent needs and new applicants.
              <br><br>Sometimes this matching process can get tricky because there might be only one unit, but multiple certified and elibile applicants with different high-needs. TSAP's matching algorithm has to work to figure out how to sort
              competing priority codes.

            <p>Actually, each step of TSAP uses a different algorithm with different levels of automation.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the step for assigning priority codes involves a pretty simple <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" tabindex="0" class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover"
                data-content="<p>A <b>decision tree</b> is a flowchart made up of branches which each represent a different variable. At each branch a decision is made until the end is reached. So for our avocados it looks like this: </p> <p class='center popover_paragraph'><img src='img/decisionTree.svg' class='popover_image' alt='A node connects to two other nodes.

                decision

            <p>The step for predicting vacancies is more like a <a class="popover_word" href="javascript:void(0)" tabindex="0" class="popover-dismiss" data-toggle="popover"
                data-content="<p>A <b>linear regression</b> draws a simple line through data points to make a prediction.

            <p>Unfortunately, TSAP doesn’t solve for the underlying problem that there are more people on the waitlist than there are available apartments. TSAP can only help sort people who are on the waitlist into vacant units, it can't make more
              vacant units.

                <h4>Data</h4>
                <p>The data TSAP uses is based on both historical data and new data input by new applicants, transfer requests, or case workers. The algorithm makes a prediction about how many units will be vacated based on how many units of a
                  certain type were vacated in the past. However, there might be other factors at play in the present day that the algorithm can’t account for. For example, maybe that building was renovated and fewer people want to leave now. This is
                  called omitted variable bias.
                </p>
                <h4> Algorithmic Model </h4>

                    eligibility interviews is more opaque.

              <p>
                The Department of Education (DOE) uses an algorithm that goes by many names: centralized clearinghouse, two-sided deferred acceptance matching, and applicant-proposing acceptance algorithm. All of these names refer to the same

              <h4 class="center">1. Students Submit</h4>
              <p>A student will "apply" to schools online, through a school counselor, or at a Family Welcome Center. In their application, they rank up to 12 schools in order of preference.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4 class="center">2. Schools Submit</h4>
              <p>Simultaneously each year, schools submit their information, like how many seats they have and what criteria they have for how to rank or prioritize students that want to apply to their school.</p>
              <p>For example, some schools called "screened schools" might say that they give priority to students with the highest 8th grade GPA first.
                Some schools called "zoned schools" might say that they give priority to students who live in their neighborhoods.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
              <h4 class="center">3. Match</h4>

              <p>The process stops when there are no available seats remaining in schools on students’ lists of preferences.</p>
              Students who are still unmatched get to resubmit a list of ranked schools from a list of schools that still have seats for a second round of the matching process.</p>

              <p>
                Unfortunately the algorithm doesn’t match everyone. About 3,000 students find themselves without a school after the first round and have to go through a second round of matching. </p>

              <p>It used to be worse. Before the DOE started using this matching algorithm, about 30,000 students weren’t getting matched with any school. In 2005, the DOE enlisted economists to help redesign it. They dropped the number of matchless
                students in part by having them rank twelve schools instead of just five. </p>

              <p>
                The new algorithm helps to more efficiently “assign as many students as possible into programs that they rank highly, given constraints due to limited seats and the high schools' own admission priorities,” as the New York Independent
                Budget Office <a href="https://ibo.nyc.ny.us/iboreports/preferences-and-outcomes-a-look-at-new-york-citys-public-high-school-choice-process.html" target="_blank">reported in 2016.</a> </p>
              <p>But the matching algorithm doesn’t challenge the underlying unjust system that maintains school segregation and the unequal distribution of educational resources. It doesn’t challenge the specific admissions priorities and
                preferences of schools. These priorities and preferences can perpetuate school segregation. </p>
              <p>Also, the matching process doesn’t apply to more competitive or highly resourced schools, like charter schools or the eight specialized high schools where students qualify by taking the Specialized High School Admissions Test
                (SHSAT). And it definitely doesn’t apply to the one audition school in New York City (LaGuardia High School). There might be good reasons for excluding some of these schools from the system, but redesigning the ADS could have been an
                opportunity to think critically about these reasons. </p>

                They're thinking about ways that we could design the admissions priorities that schools use to rank students. They believe that if we design the priorities with the express purpose of integrating schools, we will create an algorithm
                that is better at undoing an unjust system. </p>

                    about which schools are best, their desire to stay with their friends. School rankings are based on their admissions priorities, which just track what the schools want to focus on. If they want to focus on good grades, they can do
                    that. If they want to focus on students in the neighborhood, they can do that.</p>

                  <p> The matching algorithm is explainable. It follows a clear series of steps and is based on the preferences of students and schools. </p>

                  <p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/nyregion/how-game-theory-helped-improve-new-york-city-high-school-application-process.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> has covered the matching algorithm and how it works, making
                    this ADS pretty transparent.</p>

                  <p>Also, the DOE has made the process transparent to families through the <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/2019nychsdirectorycitywideenglish" target="_blank">High School
                      Directory</a>, a document that guides students through the high school application and matching process.</p>

                  <p>In May of 2018, Mayor de Blasio launched the Automated Decision Systems Task Force (ADS Task Force) in May of 2018 to review “automated decision systems, commonly known as algorithms, through the lens of equity, fairness and
                    accountability.”</p>
                  <p><strong>The ADS Task Force will be having its first public meeting on April 30, 2019.</strong> Now that you know about ADSs, you might have some ideas that you want to share with the ADS Task Force! You can share them at the meeting or
                    using <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/adstaskforce/contact/contact.page" target="blank">this online submission form</a>.</p>
                  <p>If you can't make it to the public meeting, you should still stay involved. The best way to make sure the ADS Task Force is doing its work and tackling issues that interest you is to reach out to your
                    local City Council member. You can go to "Who Represents Me? NYC" at <a href="http://www.mygovnyc.org/" target="blank">www.mygovnyc.org</a> to type in your address and find out who represents you in New York City and State.</p>
                  <p>Remember to ask your City Council member or the ADS Task Force about the purpose and design decisions we gave you! Ask things like:</p>

                  <p><strong>Purpose</strong><br>
                    What are the next ADSs that you think the City will be making?<br>
                    Why do you think the City will add automation to that decision-making process? <br>
                    How can I help make sure that the City says that the purpose of the automation is to [undo an unjust system]? I know that a neutral algorithm might worsen unjust systems.<br></p>

                  <p><strong>Bias</strong><br>What are the biases in the data set that the algorithm might be using? <br>
                    How can we use those biases for good? <br>

                    Can you explain to me how the algorithm in this ADS works? <br>
                    Can you explain to me the overall decision system of the ADS? </p>
                  <p><strong>Automation</strong><br>
                    Does the result of the algorithm determine the decision or does it just advise agency staff people in making a decision? <br>
                    Are agency staff people trained about unjust systems? <br>
                    If they saw a result that was unjust, would they know that it is unjust and how to correct it?</p>
                  <p><strong>Flexibility</strong><br>
                    How would people be able to give feedback if they think a decision from an ADS is wrong?<br>

                      <br><br>There are many questions about whether AI actually works in medicine, and where it works. Could the use of AI in medicine worsen health disparities? There are at least three reasons to believe it might. The first is a
                      training problem. Second, because AI is trained on real-world data, it risks incorporating, entrenching and
                      perpetuating the economic and social biases that contribute to health disparities in the first place. Third, even ostensibly fair, neutral AI has the potential to worsen disparities if its implementation has disproportionate
                      effects for certain groups.</div>

                      <br><br>The Dataset Nutrition Label (the Label) is a diagnostic framework that lowers the barrier to standardized data analysis. The Label provides a distilled yet comprehensive overview of dataset “ingredients” before AI model
                      development. Building a Label that can be applied across domains and data types requires that the framework
                      itself be flexible and adaptable. As such, the Label is comprised of diverse qualitative and quantitative modules generated through multiple statistical and probabilistic modelling backends, but displayed in a standardized
                      format.</div>

                      the algorithm. We use lots of tools we do not understand that make our lives more efficient. We had some disagreements with this article and its assumptions that algorithms are necessarily smarter than us.</div>

                      <br><br>Critique of those who criticize algorithms as biased. Argues that yes algorithms are biased, but they’re better than the status quo. Cites five research examples where algorithms did better than human decision making. We
                      remain skeptical. Their examples forget a lot of history and examples of failed algorithms that exacerbated racism,
                      and they don’t explain how we can ensure that algorithms are less biased.</div>

                      <br><br>Answer to Harvard Business Review's "Want Less-Biased Decisions?" Algorithms usually have no appeals method and algorithms used on a much larger scale than human decisions replicate bias at scale. “We have a
                      responsibility to understand the real-world systems with which our work will interact, and to not lose sight of the actual people who will be impacted.”</div>

                      <br><br>Cathy O’Neil explores the dark side of algorithms, which are often opaque, unregulated, and incontestable, even when they’re wrong. Most troubling, they can reinforce discrimination. Using personal stories this book
