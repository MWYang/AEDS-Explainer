          <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Porfirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items" target="_blank">Supplemental Nutrition
              Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, also
            known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p>
          <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once">But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system. That

                <p>Data are never objective. We embed our human bias when we collect, store, and use data. All data are biased.</p>

                <p>Data being biased means that when we analyze the data, the data might tell us to do something that's not purely objective. It might tell us to do something based on the existing biases of the world that it's capturing. </p>

                <p>For example, if we use arrest data by neighborhood to distribute the police force, then we may send police to the same neighborhoods that they have historically policed, which leads to more collection of arrest data in those
                  same
                  neighborhoods. This creates a vicious cycle. </p>

                <p>These biases can arise because all datasets, to some extent, are incomplete, don't accurately represent the thing they're supposed to represent, and have historical mistakes that new data is building on.</p>

            <h4> Data </h4>
            </p> Because Porfirio's bodega is in a low-income neighborhood, he is more likely to have more customers with food stamps. This is a bias in the data about bodegas in poor neighborhoods. This means that bodegas like Porfirio's receive
            more scrunity whereas a bodega in a rich neighborhood gets less scrunity. </p>
            <h4> Algorithm Model </h4>
            <p>The algorithm the USDA used to identify cash-for-food-stamps fraud was using large one time purchases as variable to indicate fraud. The algorithm couldn't distinguish between true fraud and Porfirio's IOU system. Someone decided
              that
              the model should flag certain transactions as fraudulent, so there was bias in the model against those kinds of transactions.

            The library feeds ESP is fed circulation data (like which books have been checked out) and sales data (like Amazon purchases). In case you're wondering, no it doesn't use book reviews yet.
          </div>
          <div class="col-4">
            The ESP algorithm looks for historical patterns in the data and makes suggestions for what books to stock at which branches. For example it might predict where the young adult book "Twilight" will be popular because that neighborhood has
            lots of teenagers that checked out "Dracula" and "Harry Potter".

            <p>To be fair, we don't always know exactly what librarians are thinking either when they make decisions to stock particular books. But if they're connected with the community they serve, we might trust that and can draw from their
              experience and knowledge. </p>

            <p data-scroll="toggle(.fromBottomIn, .fromBottomOut) once"> Not so fast. </p>
            <p> As a neural network, ESP doesn't work as well if there isn't a lot of data. For example, in established book genres and topics like knitting, it tends to pick the winners well. But it might have a harder time when guessing which debut
              fiction (e.g. an author’s first book) will be a hit with readers </p>
            <p> Even if we have a bunch of data from Amazon or other book sellers, the data might not be representative of many NYC communities, particularly minorities and low income individuals--some of the largest users of library services that
              could purchase fewer books. This means that the recommendations ESP produces might not reflect what patrons want and may not be easy to change unless we get a whole lot more data.</p>
            <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't
              already check out books.</p>

            <p>Yup! Preserving librarians' power to make decisions helps to address the possible problems with ESP. Still, librarians' choices may be swayed by what seems like a concrete, numerical score based on mathematical equations.</p>
            <p>ESP augments a librarian's choices by highlighting gaps in a librarian's knowledge and experience. On the flip side, it could sway librarians away from trusting their own instincts on what their branch needs.</p>

                <h4> Scale </h4>
                </p>Large scale. A lot of people use libraries.</p>
                <h4> Scope </h4>
                <p>Superficial. Books are great, but probably not as serious as other social services and it's not about life or death.</p>
                <h4> Vulnerability </h4>
                <p>This depends on how you look at it. People who need to use libraries might be more vulnerable because they don't have other means to get knowledge. People who's books don't get great reviews are more likely to be vulnerable people
                  (new authors, authors that are underrepresented, topics that are underrepresented).</p>

                <h4>Data</h4>
                </p> ESP uses a lot of data which incorporates both library and private book sale data but is unable currently to take in other forms of data like book reviews. The data doesn't account for human biased equity issues. Sales data may
                be based on higher-income individuals. Libraries should think about books that their unique populations need and value.</p>
                <h4> Algorithm Model </h4>
                <p>ESP uses a neural network. While a human doesn't make a decision about the variables that matter, using such an opaque model might mean that it's harder to know if what kinds of bias in the data are driving outcomes. </p>

                </p>ESP is advisory. It gives a score, but the Librarians can still use their own knowledge or priorities to decide how much the score guides their decisions on whether to buy a book, how many copies to buy, or where to place the
                book.</p>
