              Locals know they can count on it for groceries, even when times are tough. <br><br>Profirio works with an anti-hunger advocacy group and knows the importance of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items"
                target="_blank">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</a>, also
              known as food stamps. More than half of his customers bought their groceries with SNAP benefits from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). <br><br>But when their benefits hadn't come in yet, he let them pay on an IOU system. That
              way, long-time patrons could take home food and settle
              their bills later.

            </p> Because Profirio's bodega is in a low-income neighborhood, he is more likely to have more customers with food stamps. This is a bias in the data about bodegas in poor neighborhoods. This means that bodegas like Profirio's receive

            <h3> Algorithm Model </h3>
            <p>The algorithm the USDA used to identify cash-for-food-stamps fraud was using large one time purchases as variable to indicate fraud. The algorithm couldn't distinguish between true fraud and Porfirio's IOU system. Someone decided
              that
              the model should flag certain transactions as fraudulent, so there was bias in the model against those kinds of transactions.

                  <p> Also, it depends on what you mean by "better". What if your goal is to bring in people who aren't currently using the library? Existing library patron data wouldn't allow the algorithm to figure out preferences for people who don't already check out books.</p>
